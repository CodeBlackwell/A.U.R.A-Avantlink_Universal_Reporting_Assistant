- format, limit, offset: Specifies how the data should be formatted and how many records are to be displayed.

Instructions:

1. Identify the Main Objective:
   - Extract the value of the report_name key to understand the main objective of the query.

2. Identify Date or Time Frame:
   - Look for the filters key and extract date or time-related information. Check for keys like dim_date-mm_dd_yyyy, op, and period to understand the time frame being queried.

3. Identify Specific Entities:
   - Within the filters key, look for specific entities being queried, like dim_merchant-merchant_uuid and extract the value to identify the specific merchant being queried.

4. Identify Metrics and Dimensions:
   - Look for the cols key and extract the metrics and dimensions to be included in the report. Metrics and dimensions usually have keys like name and alias for human-readable references.

5. Identify Format and Limits:
   - Extract the values of keys like format, limit, and offset to understand how the data should be formatted and how many records are to be displayed.

6. Compose the Query:
   - Start with the main objective, mention the date or time frame, specify the entities, list down the metrics and dimensions, and mention the format and limits.

7. Review and Refine:
   - Review the composed query to ensure it captures all the necessary information from the JSON.
   - Refine the wording to ensure clarity and readability.
