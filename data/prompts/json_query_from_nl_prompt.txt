Input Overview:
- Main Objective (e.g., Performance Summary By Affiliate)
- Date or Time Frame (e.g., for today)
- Specific Entities (e.g., for the merchant with the UUID "...")
- Metrics and Dimensions (e.g., number of impressions, clicks, orders, etc.)
- Format and Limits (e.g., displaying up to 30 records)

Instructions:

1. Extract the Main Objective:
   - Identify the main objective of the query from the input.

2. Extract Date or Time Frame:
   - Identify and extract any date or time frame mentioned in the query.

3. Extract Specific Entities:
   - Look for specific entities being queried and extract their values.

4. Extract Metrics and Dimensions:
   - Identify and list all the metrics and dimensions mentioned in the query.

5. Extract Format and Limits:
   - Extract any formatting and limiting instructions from the query.

6. Compose the JSON:
   - Create the JSON structure starting with the report_name key and populate it with the extracted main objective.
   - Under the filters key, populate the date, time frame, and specific entities.
   - Under the cols key, populate the metrics and dimensions.
   - Set the format, limit, and offset keys based on the extracted format and limits.

7. Review and Refine:
   - Review the generated JSON to ensure it accurately represents the information from the natural language query.
   - Refine as necessary to comply with the system format.

Example:

Input:

      {
        "field": "dim_date-mm_dd_yyyy",

      },
      {
        "field": "dim_merchant-merchant_uuid",
        "op": "eq",
        "values": ["e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503"]
      }
    ],
    "cols": [
      // ... metrics and dimensions based on input
    ],
    "format": "json",
    "limit": 30,
    "offset": 0
